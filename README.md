## üß± System Architecture
The system is built on a multi-agent architecture where a **Master Agent** orchestrates a network of specialized worker agents. This modular design allows for complex, autonomous workflows. Orchestration can be managed using frameworks like **LangGraph, CrewAI, or AutoGen**.
